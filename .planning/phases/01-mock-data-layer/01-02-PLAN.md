<objective>
Populate all mock data fixtures with realistic hardcoded values and validate the complete mock data module with TypeScript strict mode.

Purpose: Every future screen can import typed, realistic mock data from `@/lib/mock` without any Firebase dependency. Data volume must be sufficient to populate all screen layouts (scrollable lists, grids, carousels).
Output: `lib/mock/data.ts` with 11 exported constants, updated `lib/mock/index.ts` barrel export, zero tsc errors.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create hardcoded mock data fixtures</name>
  <files>lib/mock/data.ts</files>
  <action>
Create `lib/mock/data.ts` importing types from `./types` using `import type` syntax.

Export these 11 named constants with realistic data. Use the research examples as the baseline and expand to meet minimum volume requirements.

**CRITICAL: Import ONLY from `./types`. No imports from `firebase/`, `@/lib/db/`, `@/lib/health/`, or any other module.**

**Constants to create:**

1. **MOCK_USER: MockUser** - Sarah Johnson, platinum tier, pravatar.cc avatar, example email
2. **MOCK_STATS: MockStats** - Realistic numbers: ~3420 totalMinutes, ~142.5 totalKm, ~185250 totalSteps, 12 currentStreak, 18 longestStreak, 87 totalActivities, 12 totalBadges, 3 totalChallenges
3. **MOCK_REWARDS: MockReward[]** (minimum 8 items) - Outdoor brand rewards: Arc'teryx, Patagonia, MEC, North Face, Vessi, Running Room, Lululemon, Scandinave Spa. Mix of rewardType: "code", "qr", "barcode". First 3 are featured:true. Use Unsplash image URLs (w=800&q=80). Each with unique hex color.
4. **MOCK_LEADERBOARD_FRIENDS: MockLeaderboardEntry[]** (minimum 5 entries) - Current user (Sarah Johnson, userId "mock-user-123") ranked #2 with isCurrentUser:true. Others with pravatar.cc avatars, decreasing totalTime.
5. **MOCK_LEADERBOARD_GLOBAL: MockLeaderboardEntry[]** (minimum 10 entries) - Current user ranked #4 with isCurrentUser:true. Others use abbreviated names (e.g., "David C."). Decreasing totalTime from rank 1 to 10.
6. **MOCK_ACHIEVEMENTS: MockAchievement[]** (minimum 5 badges) - Mix of earned:true (with ISO 8601 earnedDate) and earned:false (earnedDate:null). Names: Early Bird, Hiker, Rain or Shine, 10 Hour Club, Four Seasons. Icon names: "sun", "mountain", "cloud-rain", "clock", "calendar".
7. **MOCK_HERO_CARDS: MockHeroCard[]** (2 cards) - One motivation type with motivationText, one counter type with minutesActive matching MOCK_STATS.totalMinutes.
8. **MOCK_PULSE_FEED: MockPulseItem[]** (minimum 2 items) - Recent activity feed entries with ISO 8601 timestamps, using friends from leaderboard.
9. **MOCK_QUESTS: MockQuest[]** (minimum 1 quest) - "Weekend Warrior" quest with progress at 65%, 78/120 minutes.
10. **MOCK_WALLET_CARDS: MockWalletCard[]** (minimum 3 cards) - Trailblazer+ Platinum membership, BC Parks Pass 2024, NSMBA Membership. Mix of "qr" and "barcode" types. Use via.placeholder.com for logos.
11. **MOCK_AFFIRMATIONS: string[]** (minimum 7 strings) - Daily motivational affirmations for outdoor activity. Examples: "Every step counts! You're building healthy habits.", "Nature is calling. Time to answer.", "Fresh air and movement -- your body thanks you." etc.

**Conventions:**
- UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for all exported constants
- Use `as const` satisfies pattern if beneficial, or direct type annotation
- Use `import type` for type imports (tree-shaking friendly)
- Use pravatar.cc URLs for avatars (consistent with research examples)
- Use Unsplash URLs for reward images
- ISO 8601 date strings for timestamps (e.g., "2024-10-15T14:30:00Z")
- Provide raw numeric primitives, not formatted strings (screens handle formatting)
  </action>
  <verify>
Run:
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
```
Zero errors. Additionally:
```bash
grep -r "firebase\|@/lib/db\|@/lib/health" lib/mock/
```
Returns no matches.

Count verification:
```bash
grep -c "id:" lib/mock/data.ts
```
Should show 25+ (8 rewards + 5 friends + 10 global + 5 achievements + 2 hero + 2 pulse + 1 quest + 3 wallet = 36 id fields).
  </verify>
  <done>lib/mock/data.ts exports 11 named constants with realistic fixture data. Rewards has 8+ items, leaderboard friends has 5+ entries, leaderboard global has 10+ entries, achievements has 5+ badges, affirmations has 7+ strings. All data satisfies TypeScript strict mode with zero errors.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update barrel export and final validation</name>
  <files>lib/mock/index.ts</files>
  <action>
Update `lib/mock/index.ts` to re-export both types and data:

```typescript
export * from "./types";
export * from "./data";
```

Then run full TypeScript validation to confirm the complete mock module works:
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
```

Also verify zero Firebase imports in the entire lib/mock/ directory:
```bash
grep -r "firebase\|from \"@/lib/db\|from \"@/lib/health" lib/mock/
```

And verify the barrel export works by checking that all expected exports are available:
```bash
grep "export" lib/mock/index.ts
```
  </action>
  <verify>
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
```
Exit code 0.

```bash
grep -r "firebase\|@/lib/db\|@/lib/health" lib/mock/
```
Returns empty (no matches).

```bash
ls -la lib/mock/
```
Shows 3 files: types.ts, data.ts, index.ts.
  </verify>
  <done>lib/mock/index.ts re-exports all types and data. The complete mock module (types.ts, data.ts, index.ts) passes TypeScript strict mode with zero errors and zero Firebase imports. Any screen can now `import { MOCK_USER, MockUser } from "@/lib/mock"` successfully.</done>
