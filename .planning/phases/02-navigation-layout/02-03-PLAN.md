<objective>
Add stub action buttons to Home and Squad screens: inline "+" button on Home for future activity logging, "Add Friend" text button in Squad screen header. Both show "Coming Soon" toast via HeroUI Native Toast.

Purpose: Makes the app feel intentional by showing where future features will live, with polished feedback when users tap stub buttons.
Output: Two action buttons with toast feedback — no navigation, just UX polish.

Key files:
@app/(tabs)/index.tsx — Home screen (will have TopBar from 02-02 if already executed, or placeholder from 02-01)

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add "+" button to Home screen with Coming Soon toast</name>
  <files>
    app/(tabs)/index.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
    Read `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` first to see its current state (may have been modified by Plan 02-02 if it ran first).

    Add an inline "+" button to the Home screen:

    **Button placement (from CONTEXT.md):** Inline in content, not a floating button. Place it as the first content item below the TopBar (or below the title text if TopBar is not yet added). This is a Phase 2 placeholder — the exact position will be refined in Phase 3 when actual Home content is built.

    **Button design:**
    - Use `Pressable` with `Plus` icon from lucide-react-native
    - Text: "Add Activity"
    - Layout: row with Plus icon + text
    - Style: accent/primary color background at 10% opacity, rounded, centered text
    - Use Uniwind className: something like `mx-4 mt-4 flex-row items-center justify-center py-3 rounded-xl`
    - Dynamic color via theme: accent background with opacity, accent text

    **Toast:**
    - Import `useToast` from `heroui-native` (or the correct HeroUI toast import)
    - On press, show toast:
      ```typescript
      toast.show({
        variant: 'default',
        label: 'Coming Soon',
        description: 'Activity logging will be available in a future update!',
        placement: 'top',
      });
      ```
    - If `useToast` is not available or has a different API, check HeroUI Native's toast documentation and adapt. HeroUI Native Toast may use `Toast.show()` static method instead of a hook.

    **IMPORTANT:** Do NOT break or remove any existing content in the file. Only ADD the button to what's already there. Read the file first to understand its current structure.
  </action>
  <verify>
    `npx tsc --noEmit` passes.
    `grep "Coming Soon" app/(tabs)/index.tsx` confirms toast text exists.
    `grep "Add Activity" app/(tabs)/index.tsx` confirms button text exists.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Home screen has inline "+" Add Activity button that shows "Coming Soon" toast on tap.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add "Add Friend" button to Squad screen header with Coming Soon toast</name>
  <files>
    app/(tabs)/squad.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
    Read `app/(tabs)/squad.tsx` first to see its current state.

    Add an "Add Friend" text button to the Squad screen header area:

    **Button placement (from CONTEXT.md):** Text button in the top-right of the Squad screen header. Place it in a row with the "Your Squad" title, or just below the TopBar if TopBar is present.

    **Button design:**
    - Text: "Add Friend"
    - Style: accent/primary color text, font-semibold, no background (text button)
    - Position: right-aligned in a header row that contains the title on the left and "Add Friend" on the right
    - Use `Pressable` wrapping a `Text` component

    **Toast:**
    - Import toast from heroui-native (same pattern as Task 1)
    - On press, show toast:
      ```typescript
      toast.show({
        variant: 'default',
        label: 'Coming Soon',
        description: 'Friend invitations will be available soon!',
        placement: 'top',
      });
      ```

    **Layout pattern:**
    ```
    <View className="flex-row items-center justify-between px-4">
      <Text>Your Squad</Text>
      <Pressable onPress={handleAddFriend}>
        <Text className="text-accent font-semibold">Add Friend</Text>
      </Pressable>
    </View>
    ```

    **IMPORTANT:** Do NOT break or remove any existing content in the file. Only ADD the button to what's already there. Read the file first.
  </action>
  <verify>
    `npx tsc --noEmit` passes.
    `grep "Add Friend" app/(tabs)/squad.tsx` confirms button text exists.
    `grep "Coming Soon" app/(tabs)/squad.tsx` confirms toast text exists.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Squad screen has "Add Friend" text button in header area that shows "Coming Soon" toast on tap.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. `npx tsc --noEmit` passes with zero TypeScript errors
2. Home screen has visible "+" / "Add Activity" inline button
3. Squad screen has "Add Friend" text button in header area
4. Both buttons trigger "Coming Soon" toast on tap
5. No navigation occurs on button press (toast only)
6. Toast displays with HeroUI Native Toast component
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- "+" Add Activity button visible on Home screen, shows "Coming Soon" toast on tap
- "Add Friend" button visible on Squad screen header, shows "Coming Soon" toast on tap
- Both toasts use HeroUI Native Toast (not custom implementation)
- No broken imports or TypeScript errors
